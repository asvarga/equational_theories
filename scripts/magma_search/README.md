# Magma Search

Search for proofs of implication/non-implication in magmas.

The goal is to have a tool you can just run in the background that might occasionally find a proof.

### Usage

Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

```bash
# defaul usage:
cargo run
# for help:
cargo run -- --help
```

Press `q` to quit.

By default, it will use `db.ron` as the database file.
